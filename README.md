Repository for the MCLv3 code from planete-bcast.inrialpes.fr. Created to capture changes needed on modern Linux systems

This fork from jcable/mcl has only been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.  Everything currently compiles, but a number of
the applications included with the software do not work.  It includes the updated LDPC v2.1 library, but also keeps
the original LDPC v1.8 library from the mcl software.

You need to install the libxerces-c-dev package for the build to succeed.
